Computers use electrical signals to trigger logic gates in order to store and manipulate data. The reason logic gates use binary is because on off is a high fidelity signal, as opposed to a more multi channel of electrical frequences going through gates. Mechanical computers could indeed use non binary computation through gearings. though the video calls the mechanical computer clunky they were sublimely complex for the time they were made.

 
Computers were originally just calculators 

input > Processing using algorithms to manipulate storage to produce > output

output can control many things like displays to robot to being the input for other computers.

The term Turing complete refers for a computational mechanism which could hypothetically process an infinite input tap

They over simplify electronics to modern binary which opted into due to heat and electrical effiencies

Binary is base 2 with 1 and 0, with a positional

They keep saying "wires" when they mean transistors which are the on off gates as references by moores law.

They discuss color display and picels. I agree the amount of data is beyond normal comprehension if imagined as concrete objects. 

Circuits allows interface

Logic gates of on and off circuits allows the storage of binary data.

not gate changes the imput

or gate function when either put works

and gate requires both imputs to be on to output

This is all minecraft redstone lol.

Electricity is near the speed of light and the small the circuit the less the distance it must travel thus faster.


Input devices handle that part > 

Sensors and interfaces like touch pads or keyboard are input devices


Output devices are like motors, printers, and displays and so many other things


Central processing unit controls and process data, centrally.

It cycles through commands like a turing tape based on inputs.

binary code is basic language, and the language is designed to create binary commands, basically they are go between languages

The Operating system is the master software which allows it manage other software and allow permissions

The Switchs for fractions of a second to appear to be multitasking.

Leanring to code empowers this cornerstone technology which our civilization is perked upon.

Nice. like the visualization of the cpu processing and the explanation of gigahertz

RAM is Random Access Memory and contains a list of where data is controlled by CPU


Oh wait that was past the play list and started to define how cpu work in  great detail. sorry
