# Welcome to my attempt to Learn to Code



My name is Matthew Stewart. This first is my page created in CodeFellows 102 class. It is about the growth mindset as that is the core to success in this program..

These are the note I wrote about Growth Mindset while listening:

"Learning is possible" paraphrase of Alfred Binet creator of IQ Test

## List of reminders
- If I feel like I need to give up, instead I need to try new strategy.
- These classes and coding is **MEANT** to be hard. Presevere and triumph.
- Learn from mistakes.  
- Remember though I don't know, it is merely I don't know _yet_.



Below I am going to leave the GitHub markdown Definition page for future reference

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Pale-Crusader/learning-journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Pale-Crusader/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
