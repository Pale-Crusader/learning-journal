## Overview

### Stacked Learning
* Exposition of a concept, demonstration, then moving on quickly
* Next concept will involve previous concept
* Frustrating way to learn, very uncomfortable, 15 minutes rule

### Canvas
* This is where you turn in assignments
* It is organized modules
* Career Work by end of 1st day
* Lab Today is Make a Notes Repo
* Attend a Meet-Up is 40 Points!!
* Career Work be Proactive and don't let it sneak up by end of day.
* Reading assignment a are meant before class but locked at end of day!
* Learning Journals: Formalize your thoughts
* Great way is view by Calander View, Some things are due later but can be done earlier like a Meet-up

### Github
* A website
* File cabinet for your work
* Let's us share and collaborate
* Git is the Version Control System, GitHub is not a Version Control System.
* Git is software, it allows multiple versions of documents 
* Gist is something we're making today, it is a single file repository, for our assignment

### VScode
* Recommended Text editor
* Providing code style specification with a linter: eslint
* JS is not whitespace sensitive 
* Ecra Script = ES = Javascript
* Configured with a file ```.eslintrc.json```
* Need to have json 
* Create a filed called .eslintrc.json in the root of each of the project directories/folder
* Clone Class Repository this is where class resources live
* 

### Terminal

### HTML and CSS and JS Basics

Not "difficult" but the work load is heavy
