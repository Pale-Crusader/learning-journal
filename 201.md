Swallow Pride and turn it in at end of day

Everyone write terrible code, but works to make less terrible each day with help and feedback. Have to be willing to change and let old self die.

## Overview

### Stacked Learning
* Exposition of a concept, demonstration, then moving on quickly
* Next concept will involve previous concept
* Frustrating way to learn, very uncomfortable, 15 minutes rule

### Canvas
* This is where you turn in assignments
* It is organized modules
* Career Work by end of 1st day
* Lab Today is Make a Notes Repo
* Attend a Meet-Up is 40 Points!!
* Career Work be Proactive and don't let it sneak up by end of day.
* Reading assignment a are meant before class but locked at end of day!
* Learning Journals: Formalize your thoughts
* Great way is view by Calander View, Some things are due later but can be done earlier like a Meet-up

### Github
* A website
* File cabinet for your work
* Let's us share and collaborate
* Git is the Version Control System, GitHub is not a Version Control System.
* Git is software, it allows multiple versions of documents 
* Gist is something we're making today, it is a single file repository, for our assignment

### VScode
* Recommended Text editor
* Providing code style specification with a linter: eslint
* JS is not whitespace sensitive 
* Ecra Script = ES = Javascript
* Configured with a file ```.eslintrc.json```
* Need to have json 
* Create a filed called .eslintrc.json in the root of each of the project directories/folder
* Clone Class Repository this is where class resources live
* 

### Terminal
* ```pwd``` Print Working Directory, says what folder you're in
* ```cd``` Change Directory ../ can be used multiple times like ```../../``` to hop up multiple directories, or directory below
* ```ls``` lists content of working directory adding a ```-l``` shows long view ```-a``` shows hidden files adding a dot to a file means it is hidden in, ```-la``` shows long view with hidden items
* ```mkdir``` makes a directory, which is a folder (at provided path)
* ```touch``` makes a file in the directory which you are in, but also can make a path which leads to that file (at provided path)
* ```rm``` is remove command aka Delete, if removing a directory needs ```-r``` (at provided path) this recursively deletes everything within directory and directory iteself
* ```rmdir``` only deletes empty directories, the above is better
* ```cp``` Copy a file (at twos provided path) ```./``` current working directory
* ```mv``` Moves a file (at twos provided path) can renamed if filename in second path different
* ```git add .``` Add for Git, aka stage
* ```git commit -m "note text"``` git commit with notes of what 
* ```git push origin master``` git pushes

NEVER ```rm -rf``` 

### HTML and CSS and JS Basics

#### HTML
* Hyper Text Markup Language
* Organization

#### CSS
* Cascading Style Sheets
* Makes things look good

#### Example

```
<html>
    <head>
    <!-- meta data -->
    <title>Test Page Example</title>
    </head>
    <style>
    header {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
        background-color: aqua;
    }
    aside {
        color: blue
    }
    </style>
    <body>
        <header>TOP</header>
        <aside>SIDE</aside>
        <footer>BOTTOM</footer>
        <script>
        <!-- assigning a value  AKA makes a variable-->
        <!-- is a bucket which holds something, var is keyword for defining the bucket -->
        <!-- var name = 'Matthew'; -->
        <!-- = is assign, == compares without type === compares with type -->
        <!-- console.log(name);
        alert(name); -->
        <!-- should feel uncomfortable for using premade items which we didn't define ourselves -->
        var name = prompt('What is your name?');
        console.log(name);
        var color = prompt('what is your favorite color?');
        alert('Hey there' + name + ', your your favorite color is ' + color);
        </script>
    </body>
<html>
```

Cascading Style Sheets

### Javascript
* Interactivity
* Watching and listening
* Functionality: Calculation, http requests, animation
