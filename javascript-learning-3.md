Structure of Comparison operations

example
(score>=pass)

create variable and then assign or assign at same time like this:

var pass = 50;
var score = 90;

how used
var hasPassed = score >= pass;

always is a boolean result.  true or false

what is being compared (operand) does not require single value or variable name

When comparing two comparison it is done like this

var comparison = (score1 + score2) > (highscore1 + high score2)

logical operators 

&& test more than one condition
|| test if at least on is true
! logical not

This are logic gates

if statements evaluate a condition for if it is true
else gives a second code block a chance to run if false
switch always has a value assigned too it with parenthesis then lists cases fore this value in the code block

switch (valuename) {
	
	

}



while loop are for when you don't know how many, like username and password

example 

while (Operation){

};


var quanity = function() {
	var answer = prompt("howmany do you want?");
	
	for(var i = 0; i < cart.length ; i++){
	console.log(i);
	}
}

i is for index positions with list aka array
i is a placeholder for index

lists are within []
indexes start counting at 0
list is named cart with a cart.length is 
i++ increaments after running block of code

defining a list 

var list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
