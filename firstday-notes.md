These are the note I wrote about Growth Mindset while listening during class:

"Learning is possible" paraphrase of Alfred Binet creator of IQ Test

The actual  quote which I looked up to post here:
_“A few modern philosopher's assert that an individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism.... With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before.”_ ~Alfred Binet

## List of reminders
- If I feel like I need to give up, instead I need to try new strategy.
- These classes and coding is **MEANT** to be hard. Presevere and triumph.
- Learn from mistakes.  
- Remember though I don't know, it is merely I don't know _yet_.

To summarize what the growth mindset is, essentially it is being willing to push past preconcieved limits you've set for yourself and embrace new thinking and pushing through difficulty.
