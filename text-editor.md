# Text Editors and IDEs

Choosing a text editor is a matter of personal preference and what is most important is that you choose one that you can get results in. This is because results are the ultimate proof that you have chosen the "right" (as in _"right for you"_ ) editor.

### This next part is so important I am quoting it verbatim

> 1.) code completion;  
2.) syntax highlighting;  
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and  
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

I'll add spell check is nice too!


Code completion means that it auto-completes common coding conventions, like auto-completes normal words on phones. Big potential time saver.

Syntax highlighting is important because it makes different portions of the code highlighted different colors for ease of reading and seeing what each piece's purpose

It is normal to expect my taste to change, and to want more feature as I learn more. The more i know the more advanced tools will be useful.

It is important to be editing in plain text to avoid formatting issue.

It is also important to save the file in the format/file extension you intend it to have so it may be read properly.

### The Article listed these third party options:

* Notepad++ which I have because it has great search and replace functions.
* Text Wrangler which is for Mac only so it doesn't apply to me at this time.
* BB Edit which is a software which needs purchased
* Visual Studio Code which was demoed in class by the teacher and looks amazing, especially the autocomplete! Even better the article lists it as free. Also the teacher said we'd be using this.
* Atom which is also free and for Windows. It is associated with GitHub which is nice.
* Brackets is also free and made for Windows. It is made by Adobe and has a live preview options
* Sublime Text which is paid for software. For $70 it is feature packed.

Text Editors edit text. Integrated Development Environment is actually a collection of software. To Quote

> An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

# Terminal
Terminal is a  ware to directly interface with files and folders via a command prompt style console instead of the regular Graphical user interface. It is opened as an application or program. The console is known as the shell. Like Minecraft command, you can use the up arrow to page up to previous commands you've typed as a shortcutt.

### List of Terminal Commands
* ls listed everything within directory
* cd means Change Director
* pwd is how you find what directory you're in, it stands for Print Working Directory
* mkdir is command for making directory, it stands for Make Directory
* touch then file name to make new file name
* open then file name open files name
* Ctl + S is Save for file after adding content
* ls -la listed permissions and history < I need help with this>
* cat then file name shows the content of the file
* mv is the command for Moving files

This is what I did to confirm my setup for tomorrow.
