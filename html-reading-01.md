* Design theory
* Design tips


Target Audience is key to reaching the goals for the site.

The book lists Demographics in a way to make thinking what they care about and want in a site easy.

Consider the reason those demographics or others come to the site. Motivations and goals may vary greatly.

Consider what most would want. This is a reasoning and empathic excercise.

Once you know whom and why they come to the site you are in position to consider what information they need and in what priority!

Another consideration is how often people will visit the site, for updating relevant information purposes.

Site maps are a diagram of how the site is structured.

Wireframes are **simple** sketches to convey and collaberate where things go on each page of the site. The should not even include color schemes, that simple!

### It is vital to know the message you're trying to convey. 

* Content, like logos or what the site says is one part
* Organizaion, which is how things are grouped togther is another
* Prioritation, which is what parts of the site are emphasized, is a third

Most people skim. Size, color ans style communicates volumes and is an invisible hand guiding thier eyes where to go.

Visual Hierarchy is the oder in whichthe eyes see things, and is affected by visual contrast between what is shown. Higher contrast items pop up first.

Images are good for high constrast item. Well design visual hierarchy makes navigating the site natural, but requires a gentle touch to avoid too much contrast.

### Types of groupings and similarity

* proximity, simply being close
* closure, complicated interlocking pattern draw things together
* continuance, being placed in a row, line or curve
* white space, space used between other groupings to imply a greater whole or pattern 
* color, background color tying things together
* borders, put a line or other embellishment are things

Humans are pattern finding machines! We find similarities everywhere. is repetition of a huge variety of kinds are done people will unconsciously notice. text, font, shape, orientational, all kinds of stuff! Room to be creative in.

The key is consistency, a pattern broken is no longer a pattern recognized.

Headings help organize.
